export const modalBodyOne = `Rapid Budgeting App is a UK based budgeting tool that aims to give users a basic understanding of their finances after entering just a handful of numbers.

Many young professionals find themselves spending hours setting up tedious spreadsheets with complex formulas, just to understand how much money they will have at the end of the month. These quickly become inaccessible and often seem not worth the effort. Moreover, budgeting calculators you often find online have far too many options for something which could be so simple.

With Rapid Budgeting App, the aim is to do the broad strokes well with an intuitive UI and leave the complexities as optional. We don't promise to get the the calculations right down to the penny, but we do promise to get you somewhere close so you can have easy access to your finances.`;
